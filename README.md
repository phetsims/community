Welcome to the PhET Common Code Libraries Community repo!

This repository houses discussion and resources for the developer community using PhET Common Code Libraries to create Interactive Simulations and other web interactives in HTML5.

## What are PhET Common Code Libraries?

They are a collection of libraries built around an MVC framework that can be used **together or separately** to support an interactive web project. Each library is housed PhET uses many or all of these libraries when creating an educational interactive simulation. Some libraries are more specific to our usage, including assets and branding, but most offer more generalizable use cases.

### Common Code Libraries

<!--  TABLE OF EACH LIBRARY WE WOULD BE OKAY TO SUPPORT WITH SHORT DESCRIPTION -->

If you would like to use use a built version of the libraries, download them as phet-lib from the [phet-lib repo](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib)

## Using Common Code Libraries to Make Web Interactives in HTML5

For a current overview of setting up and using PhET's common code libraries, see the [PhET Development Overview](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-development-overview.md).

For a simple demonstration of using common code centered around `scenery`, see [Scenery Lab Demo](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-lab-demo)

# PhET Common Code Libraries vs. PhET Interactive Simulations

PhET Common Code Libraries are the HTML5/JavaScript/TypeScript APIs (detailed above) that PhET Interactive Simulations are built on. The use of PhET Common Code Libraries **is not limited to creating interactive science and math simulations!** It can be used to support the creation of all web interactives. PhET Common Code supports rich and inclusive multimodal interaction, including the architecture to build robust screen reader access when used in conjunction with our [Interactive Description Design Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/description-design-for-interactive-learning-resources)
