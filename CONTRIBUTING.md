# Contributing to PhET Interactive Simulations

PhET encourages pull requests to any of its GitHub repositories.

- See the instructions for signing the [CLA](./CLA.md) before contributing.
- Fork the repo(s) required.
- For common code where it applies, please do not change or commit to
  `dist/`, these stable built versions are updated less regularly.
- Use `npm config set save false` to avoid committing
  `package-log.json` files to version control.
- Run appropriate browser unit tests and simulation tests to ensure no
  regressions.
- Please feel free to reach out to us via GitHub discussions if
  you need help.

## Process

Upon submitting a PR, a PhET team member will do a code review. They
might ask you to make changes. It's also possible you will need to rebase
your PR at some point.
